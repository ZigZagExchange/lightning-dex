# ETH - SOL Bridge
For a mulitude of reasons we are not using a solana program / smart contract for SOL deposits. This is something we should probably add later.
For now SOL deposits work similar to BTC deposits. When a request is made to the `/deposit_address` endpoint a new keypair is derived from the master private key (priv key for liquidity pool) and an ID assigned to the deposit address.
This means that private keys for the deposit wallet are not stored in our DB. When the sol_deposit script detects a transaction into that deposit wallet it will send the deposits SOL back into the liqudity pool wallet and create a row in the `bridges` table.
